# **The Need and Feasibility of the United Nations to Lead the Human Community in Creating a Digital Planet(001)**

### *--An Open Letter to UN Secretary-General Guterres and Global Sages*

 

## **Preface**

 

"*Xianda（贤达）*" is an ancient Chinese title. It refers to a gentleman who has both virtue and wisdom, who is reasonable and has a certain social prestige. There is no fully appropriate equivalent in English, so we will simply substitute “Sages”in this letter. Antonio Guterres, the current Secretary-General of the United Nations, is of course a Sages with human feelings and a human mission.

 

The recorded history of human civilization, which has been developed for more than 5,000 years, has taken many turns and twists and turns, and has faced various crises and tests countless times. But in the end, with the efforts and leadership of the ancient sages and sages of mankind, they all turned out to be good and survived. However, the outbreak of an unprecedented global pandemic of the new crown in 2019 exposed various fatal wounds in human society that were not apparent before, directly endangering the fate of all mankind. It can be said that the life-and-death crisis facing human civilization today is more frightening and imminent than ever before. But at the same time, a new hope and a new civilization, full of infinite vitality, infinite abundance and infinite beauty, are also beckoning to mankind. In front of us is the abyss of ten thousand fathoms and burning flames; on the other side is the paradise in the clouds and blossoming flowers. The wheel of human destiny has reached the edge of this unprecedented bifurcation, and inertia is driving the wheel forward rapidly. The only way to avoid falling into the abyss and regaining the clouds is to unite the common strength of all mankind to make a big brake and a big turn. Today, the best hope for uniting the common forces of humanity to accomplish this sacred mission of humanity still lies with the United Nations.

 

However, the credibility and influence of the United Nations in the international community has been declining in recent years, and it is completely incapable of carrying out this mission. The other dominant forces in the world landscape, be they the United States, China or Western Europe, do not have the possibility of gathering a common global force, at least for the time being. If mankind is indeed facing some kind of terminal disaster, it needs to gather global consensus and global power to save itself. But we don't even have a leader who can effectively gather global consensus and power, isn't this the most helpless and scary part of human society at the moment? So, what are the great crises facing human society, what is wrong with the deteriorating and overburdened UN, how should human beings resolve these crises, and how can the UN live up to the expectations and take up the heavy responsibility again. This open letter would like to make some positive analysis and exploration in this regard.

 

Through analysis and exploration, perhaps we will realize more clearly that human society is indeed facing a great crisis, and the United Nations is also at a critical moment of life and death. Humanity needs to save itself, and so does the United Nations. Helping the UN to save itself is the best entry point for humanity to do so. In this letter, we propose the plan of **"Building a Digital Earth, Reconstructing a New Civilization for Human Society".** It is such a package solution that starts from helping the United Nations to save itself and finally completes the self-help of human beings. By leading mankind to build a digital earth in the meta-universe, the UN will reconstruct a new wealth system and a new economic order for mankind, and thus achieve a new civilizational reconstruction of human society. In this way, not only can we fundamentally solve the various crises of human society, but also make the United Nations become a veritable leader and dominator of the new human civilization in the digital earth.

 

According to this plan, the United Nations is the natural choice to lead the human community in creating a digital planet. But it is not the only choice. Because, in the process of building a digital earth, the leader actually plays the role of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). But the UN mechanism and system are ready-made, although the credibility and influence of the global sovereign state level is much less than before, but in the minds of ordinary people around the world, its authority and credibility or no other organizations can be compared. By the United Nations to lead the human society to create a digital planet, at the moment is undoubtedly the most appropriate, but also the most effective. However, in case the United Nations does not understand, reluctance, or because of various other issues, there is no way to come forward to assume such a historical mission. Any sage, any benevolent person, any person of conscience on this planet, as long as they are willing to connect with each other and firmly consensus, can also build a fully civil DAO to lead human society to accomplish this sacred mission of supreme glory.

This letter is addressed both to the Secretary-General of the UN and to the Sages of the world for this reason.

# **联合国引领人类社会打造数字地球的必要性和可行性**

### *——致联合国秘书长古特雷斯及全球贤达的公开信*

 

## **序言**

 

“贤达”，是中国古代的一种称谓,。指那些有既有德行、又有智慧，通情达理，还有一定社会声望的君子。现任联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯，当然也是一名具备人类情怀且背负人类使命的“贤达”。

有记载的人类文明，已有5000多年发展史，千回百转，蜿蜒曲折，无数次面临种种危机考验。但最终都在人类古圣先贤的努力和引领下，逢凶化吉、绝处逢生。然而，2019年爆发的一场史无前例全球新冠疫情大流行，暴露出人类社会种种以前还不明显的致命伤，直接危及到全人类的命运。可以说，今天人类文明所面临的生死危机，比任何时候都更可怕、更临近了。但同时，一个充满无限生机、无限富足、无限美好的新希望和新文明，也正在向人类频频招手。前面是万丈深渊、烈焰焚烧；一旁却是云中天堂、繁花似锦。人类的命运之轮，已经驶到了这个亘古未有的分叉口边缘，惯性驱动着车轮还在迅猛向前。唯有凝聚全人类共同之力量进行大刹车和大转向，才能避免跌落深渊，并重上云霄。而今天，能够凝聚人类共同之力，完成这一人类神圣使命的最大希望依然在联合国。

可是，联合国近些年来在国际社会上的公信力和影响力却每况日下，完全无力担此使命。而世界格局中的其他主导力量，无论是美国、中国、西欧，至少在眼下，任何一家都还不具备凝聚全球共同之力的可能性。如果人类当下确实面临着某种灭顶之灾，需要凝聚全球共识和全球力量来自救。可我们却连一个能有效凝聚全球共识和力量的引领者都没有，这难道不是人类社会当下最无奈，也是最恐怖的地方。那么，人类社会究竟面临着哪些巨大危机，联合国每况愈下、不堪重负究竟出了什么问题，人类应该怎样化解这些危机，联合国又如何才能不负众望、再担重任。本公开信想就此进行一些积极的分析和探索。

通过分析和探索，或许我们会更清晰的意识到，人类社会确实面临着巨大危机，而联合国也同样处在生死存亡的关键时刻。人类需要自救，联合国也需要自救。而帮助联合国进行自救，正是人类实现自救的一个最好切入点。本信中，我们提出的**《打造数字地球，重构人类社会新文明》**规划。就是这样一个从帮助联合国进行自救入手，最终完成人类自救的一揽子解决方案。联合国通过引领人类在元宇宙中打造数字地球，重构人类新财富体系和新经济秩序，进而实现人类社会的新文明重构。这样一来，不仅可以从根本上化解人类社会的种种危机，也让联合国在数字地球中，成为名副其实的人类新文明引领者和主导者。

按照这个规划，由联合国来引领人类社会打造数字地球自然是首选。但也并非唯一选择。因为，在人类打造数字地球的过程中，引领者实际上担当的也就是一个DAO（去中心化自组织系统）的角色。只不过联合国机制和系统都是现成的，虽然在全球主权国家层面的公信力和影响力大不如从前，但在全球普通老百姓心目中，其权威性和公信力还是没有其他组织可以比拟的。由联合国出面来引领人类社会打造数字地球，在当下无疑是最合适、也是最有效的。可是，万一联合国因为看不懂、不愿意，或者因这样那样的问题，没办法站出来担当这样一个历史使命。我们这个地球上的任何一名社会贤达、任何一名仁人志士、任何一名有良知的人，只要大家愿意彼此连接起来、坚定共识，也一样可以构建一个完全民间性质的DAO，引领人类社会完成这一无上荣耀之神圣使命。

本信既致联合国秘书长，又致全球贤达，皆因于此。
